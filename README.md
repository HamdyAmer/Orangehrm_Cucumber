Project Summary: OrangeHRM Test Automation
Project Overview
I implemented an automated testing solution for the OrangeHRM demo application using Cucumber BDD framework with Selenium WebDriver and Java. The project tested user management functionality in the admin module, including adding, searching for, and deleting users.
Technologies Used
•	Cucumber: For behavior-driven development and readable test scenarios
•	Selenium WebDriver: For browser automation
•	Java: As a programming language
•	Maven: For dependency management and build automation
•	TestNG: For test execution and assertions
Implementation Details
I created a complete BDD test suite with:
1.	Feature File: Written in Gherkin syntax, describing the user management scenario
2.	Step Definitions: Java code implementing each step in the feature file
3.	Page Objects: Following the Page Object Model design pattern
4.	Configuration: WebDriver setup, reporting, and test environment configuration
